### Introduction

Middle Russian Corpus (MidRus) is part of the Russian National Corpus (http://ruscorpora.ru) included in the collection of historical corpora (Sichinava 2014). 
The annotation of MidRus takes into account the research interests of the following users:  
* researchers in the Middle Russian period of the language  
* researchers of the Old Russian languages accustomed to the schema ot the RNC Old Russian corpus  
* researchers of the Modern Russian language interested in the micro-diachrony studies. They are accustomed to the schema ot the RNC Main corpus  
* NLP researchers who would like to use the Middle Russian data in their computational experiments, including comparative ones based on various paleoslavic data collections.  

To meet these, somewhat different, demands, a number of specifications are considered to facilitate necessary data linking and conversion.  

The morphological annotation standard of MidRus adopts two schemas (tagsets) in parallel:
* RNC-MidRus: RNC Middle Russian tagset close to those of the RNC Main corpus and the RNC Old Russian corpus  
* UD-MidRus: Universal Dependencies tagset close to those of the UD-Church Slavic and UD-Russian data collections.  

The conversion table between RNC and UD tags is provided here: [MidRussianUD.md](https://github.com/olesar/UD_MidRussian/MidRussianUD.md).
